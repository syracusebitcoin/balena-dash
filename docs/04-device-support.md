**Notes**

- The smoothest path to getting the project going is to use the balenaDash kit from PiSupply (either [full](https://uk.pi-supply.com/products/balenadash-kit) or [barebones](https://uk.pi-supply.com/products/balenadash-kit-barebones) versions)
- See documentation for using either the PiTFT 3.5" or 2.8" resistive displays, and ensure you've set the configuration variable to make this display work
