# Motivation

![](https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2019/04/top_image.jpg)

balenaDash is a Raspberry Pi [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/cloud/) starter project that lets you set up a web frame to display family photos, dashboards, videos, social media feeds, and more.

We want to create a project that motivates users to build their own customizable web frame to show data, photos, and other media using a display and a single-board device. Use this project to solve for practical challenges around the home or office, or to even monitor data or deliver a live video feed in a production environment.

Contributors are welcome to improve this software, add sensor support, and help one another get the most out of this project.
